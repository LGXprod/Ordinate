# Q
Formerly known as Ordinate, Q is a queuing tool for organisations with waiting rooms. The core feature of Q is that enables organisations to display the position of a customer in a list anonymously. This combined with an accurate, dynamic ETAs, which is generated from an algorithm using previous Q data, increases customer satisfaction and organisation efficency in a multitude of ways:
- Patients are far less likely to get angry or stressed about the time they have waited as ETAs will eventually become more accurate than a receptionist's ETA. As well as the fact that they can see the position in the queue so they don't need to question whether a doctor has skipped them or if a receptionist has done something wrong.
- Patients can make a decision as to whether they have enough time to see a doctor with out speaking to a receptionist.

Furthermore, this web application works for organisations with pre-existing software solutions (e.g. BP for medical centres) but also for organisations with no queuing system already in place (through the use of our powerful adminstrative tools).

Q uses some of the latest technologies on the back-end such as Node JS, Express, Bcrypt, AES in combination with a reliable and accessible MySQL DataBase. On the front-end we are using many modern tools including HTML 5, CSS 3, JS, JQuery and EJS.
